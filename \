[1mNAME[0m
       shutdown - Halt, power off or reboot the machine

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m

       [1mshutdown [22m[OPTIONS...] [TIME] [WALL...]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mshutdown [22mmay be used to halt, power off, or reboot the machine.

       The first argument may be a time string (which is usually "now"). Optionally, this may be followed by a wall message
       to be sent to all logged-in users before going down.

       The time string may either be in the format "hh:mm" for hour/minutes specifying the time to execute the shutdown at,
       specified in 24h clock format. Alternatively it may be in the syntax "+m" referring to the specified number of
       minutes m from now.  "now" is an alias for "+0", i.e. for triggering an immediate shutdown. If no time argument is
       specified, "+1" is implied.

       Note that to specify a wall message you must specify a time argument, too.

       If the time argument is used, 5 minutes before the system goes down the /run/nologin file is created to ensure that
       further logins shall not be allowed.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are understood:

       [1m--help[0m
           Print a short help text and exit.

       [1m-H[22m, [1m--halt[0m
           Halt the machine.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--poweroff[0m
           Power the machine off (the default).

       [1m-r[22m, [1m--reboot[0m
           Reboot the machine.

       [1m-h[0m
           The same as [1m--poweroff[22m, but does not override the action to take if it is "halt". E.g.  [1mshutdown --reboot -h[0m
           means "poweroff", but [1mshutdown --halt -h [22mmeans "halt".

       [1m-k[0m
           Do not halt, power off, or reboot, but just write the wall message.

       [1m--no-wall[0m
           Do not send wall message before halt, power off, or reboot.

       [1m-c[0m
           Cancel a pending shutdown. This may be used to cancel the effect of an invocation of [1mshutdown [22mwith a time
           argument that is not "+0" or "now".

       [1m--show[0m
           Show a pending shutdown action and time if there is any.

           Added in version 250.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

[1mCOMPATIBILITY[0m
       The
        [1mshutdown [22mcommand in previous init systems (including sysvinit) defaulted to single-user mode instead of powering
       off the machine. To change into single-user mode, use [1msystemctl rescue [22minstead.
